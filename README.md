# Vehicle Sales Analysis
Goal: Use SQL and Tableau to analyze sales performance of domestic- and foreign-manufacturer vehicles in the US during the first half of 2015. The interactive dashboard pictured below can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/angela.rodriguez5585/viz/VehicleSalesDashboard_17213202544980/Dashboard).

## Key Metrics
* Total sales
* Average sale price
* Region of manufacture: domestic (US manufacturer) or foreign (non-US)
* State of sale

## Summary of Insights
* Nationally, sales were higher for vehicles made by foreign manufacturers, though more states were dominated by domestic sales than by foreign sales (see Fig. 2 and 3 for examples of each).
* Of the five states with the highest sales (Florida, California, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Georgia), four have more foreign sales than domestic.
* Ford, GM, and Fiat Chrysler made up nearly 100% of all domestic sales in the US. However, the top three performing foreign manufacturers (Nissan, Toyota, and BMW) made up about 54% of all foreign-manufacturer sales.
* Ford sales were the highest of all manufacturers throughout the first two quarters.
* Sale prices for both domestic and foreign vehicles decreased throughout April and early May, then increased again in mid-May.
* Foreign-manufactured vehicles tend to have higher selling prices than domestic vehicles.
* Total sales were highest in February and then dipped sharpy in March and April.

## Recommendations
* Conduct market research to identify the factors influencing potential buyers to prefer foreign vehicles over domestic ones.
* Consider research and development initiatives to enhance the quality, features, and technology of domestic vehicles to match or surpass foreign competitors.
*	Review and revise current incentives, discounts, and financing options to make domestic vehicles more attractive to potential buyers.
*	Build customer brand loyalty for domestic vehicles through loyalty programs and after-sales services like roadside assistance, maintenance, and warranty coverage.
*	Develop marketing strategies to focus on states that have higher foreign sales.
